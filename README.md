****_ Don't use yet _**. The package is buggy and npm does not allow to hide visibility unless its a scoped package. However, I will commence work on the project when I have got some free time. Cheers**

This project is bootstrapped using the popular create-react-app (CRA) with typescript support (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#readme). The aim is build on top of that with libraries and tools used daily alongside the basic configuration that comes with CRA.

This is configured with the following

-   prettier
-   eslint
-   husky
-   lint-staged
-   react error boundary

With this library one can focus on writing components without configuration little or no extra configuration.
